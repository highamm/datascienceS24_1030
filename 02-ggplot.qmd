## Section 2.3: Introduction to Plotting


A Single Quantitative Variable

```{r}
stat113_df
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = GPA)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "lightpink", bins = 15)

ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = GPA)) +
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 17)

## can have more than one geom (they get added as layers)
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = GPA)) +
    geom_histogram(colour = "gold4", fill = "magenta2", bins = 17) +
    geom_freqpoly(bins = 17)
```

Single Categorical Variable

```{r}
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Award)) +
  geom_bar(colour = "blue4", fill = "slateblue1")
```

Two Categorical Variables

```{r}
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Year, fill = SocialMedia)) +
  geom_bar() 

ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Sport, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "Proportion")
## there is a slightly higher proportion of male students
## that play a sport
```

One Categorical and One Quantitative

```{r}
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Award, y = Exercise)) +
  geom_boxplot()

stat113_df
ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Sex, y = Hgt)) +
  geom_violin(colour = "seagreen4", fill = "seagreen1")

ggplot(data = stat113_df, aes(x = Award, y = Exercise)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.10)
## in the strip plot, we can see a rough sample size per group
```
