```

Class Exercises 1 and 2

```{r}
babynames_2017m <- babynames |> filter(year == 2017 & sex == "M") |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1:10)

ggplot(data = babynames_2017m, aes(x = name, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

Class Exercises 3 and 4

```{r}
babynames_john <- babynames |> filter(name == "John" & sex == "M")
ggplot(data = babynames_john, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() ##+
  ##geom_smooth()
```

Class Exercise 5.

fitness_df |> mean(distance) is equivalent to mean(fitness_df, distance), but, the first argument to mean has to be a variable, not a data frame. 

Your Turn 1.

```{r}
babynames_not45 <- babynames |> filter(year != 1945)
babynames_whatever_n <- babynames |> filter(n >= 400 & n <= 5000)
```
