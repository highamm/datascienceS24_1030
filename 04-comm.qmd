Your Turn 1. Deleting rows with point and click is problematic- someone wouldn't be able to tell that he did so. Changing the limits and labels and copying into word is also not reproducible. Finally, you wouldn't be able to tell exactly what test he did unless he explicitly stated the excel function.

Your Turn 2.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fitness_full <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highamm/ds234_quarto/main/data_online/higham_fitness_clean.csv",
                         col_types = list(stepgoal = col_factor())) |>
  mutate(weekend_ind = case_when(weekday == "Sat" | weekday == "Sun" ~ "weekend",
                                 .default = "weekday"))

## 2.4: class exercise 3
fitness_lab <- fitness_full |>
  filter(Date == "2019-04-14" | Date == "2021-05-24") |>
  mutate(event = c("half-marathon", "grand canyon"))
## event = c() manually specifies a variable.
fitness_lab |> relocate(event)

ggplot(data = fitness_full, aes(x = Date, y = steps)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_text(data = fitness_lab, aes(label = event))
## data in geom_text() is a local data set.
```

Your Turn 3.
